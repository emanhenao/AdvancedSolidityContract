# AdvancedSolidityContract
Created an ERC20 token that was minted through a Crowdsale contract that leverages from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.
The crowdsale contract manages the entire process, allowing users to send ETH and get back PUP (PupperCoin).
The contract mints the tokens automatically and distributes them to buyers in one transaction.
